Hello!

Thank you for taking the time to look at my repository.

In coding4mygf, I will be doing exactly what the name says coding for my girlfriend!
Essentially I will be making a website she can access that will notify her of any 
dates I have planned or any upcoming events we can go to. I will also plan to record
every date and save it to the website to look back at later on. 

To build this webpage I will be using CSS, HTML, and JS.

Setup:
1. npm init -y
2. npm install
3. Create index.html, script.js, and styles.css
4. npm install live-server --save-dev
5. Add "start": "live-server" to package.json
6. npm start (to view webpage)

Git:
1. git init
2. git add .
3. git commit -m "message here"
4. git remote add origin (url here)
5. git push -u origin main
