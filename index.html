        <h1>Hello Aysha :)</h1>
        <p>
          Our two year anniversary is quickly approaching and I could not be
          more excited. We've done and grown so much in the past two years as
          indivduals and in our relationship. The past two years hold so many
          memories, but a few of my favorites are:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Spending our six month anniversary in the most perfect little home.
          </li>
          <li>
            Driving up to Dallas to watch the UT vs OU football game and me
            somehow being able to sneak in.
          </li>
          <li>
            Graduating together and doing all the grad stuff together (i.e. Grad
            photos, commencement, walking the stage)
          </li>
          <li>
            Moving into our little apartment together and truly getting tested
            as a couple.
          </li>
          <li>
            The cabin trip for Kristy and Calvin's bday where we ate some
            mushrooms, watched UT lose (...again), and did all sorts of fun
            little things.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h1><u>Itinerary</u></h1>
        <h5>
          What is a two year anniversary if there is no celebration? Here is our
          itinerary for our special day! :)
        </h5>
        <p>
          <b><u>Date:</u> </b> Since our anniversary is on a Monday we'll celebrate on
          Sunday 1/26 instead.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Time:</u> </b> Start getting ready at 10:00AM we will leave the house
          at 11:00AM
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Activity 1:</u> </b> 11:30AM - 1:00PM Mueller's Farmers Market: Grab
          breakfast at which ever stall looks good. Shop around a bit looking at
          the fresh produce and flowers.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Activity 2:</u> </b> 1:30-3:00PM Blanton Museum of Art: Take a walk
          around and explore the updated Blanton Museum. Maybe take a couple of
          pictures here and there so make sure you're dressed to impress. Also
          free admission with a UT ID...score!
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Break Time:</u> </b> 3:30-4:30PM Can't have our two year anniversary
          without some boba... So we'll be taking a trip to Terrazo, Milk + Tea,
          or what ever boba place you're feeling! Maybe Happy Lemon if you're
          wanting a bubble waffle :)
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Refresh and get ready for dinner:</u> </b> 5:00-6:45PM After boba come
          back home to get dressed for dinner. Shower, prep, makeup during this
          time also just some time to wind down and relax for a bit.
        </p>
        <p>
          <b><u>Dinner at The Guesthouse:</u> </b>7:30-9:15PM Reservation at The
          Guesthouse at 7:30PM. More American-ish food with great ambiance and
          live DJ.

        <p>
          <b><u>Potential Activity 3:</u> </b> 9:30 - After dinner ends depending on
          how we feel there are a few options. The first is cidercade, second is
          ice cream if there weren't any good desert choices, and lastly just to
          go home and enjoy each other's company :)
